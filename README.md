HackUCI 2020 Project

Developed a website that improves the readability of the Course Prerequisites of the University of California Irvine (UCI) (https://www.reg.uci.edu/cob/prrqcgi).
Currently, ZotReq can only be used to search for COMPSCI courses, but we are looking forward to expand the prerequisites for the all UCI departments.
